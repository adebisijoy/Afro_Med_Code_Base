# Deep Learning for CervicaL Cancer Screening

#### Proposed Technology: Deep Learning
#### Datasets: SiPakMed dataset, External dataset
#### Motivation: To build an AI model for cervical cancer detection, especially in low-resource settings
#### Problem Statement: Ca-Cx screening is a tedious test that is prone to inter-observer variability.
## Data Sources

This project utilizes publicly available cervical cytology image datasets:

- **Kaggle Dataset**: Cervical Cancer - Largest SIPaKMeD Cell Image Dataset
